# BBCNewsLabs_CodingExercise

Hello,

This is my work for the BBC NewsLab coding excercise.

To be able to run the script, just download or `git clone https://github.com/danielepalumbo89/BBCNewsLabs_CodingExercise.git ` this repository in your Downloads folder.

The `/data` folder contains the original data for the exercise `bulgarian-direct-assessment.csv`.

The `/exploration` folder contains the R script.

The `/output` folder contains the three generated outputs as .csv files as requested in the exercise.
